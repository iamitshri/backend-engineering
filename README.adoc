= Backend Engineering

== Concepts

- Open API
    * Contract Driven Design

- Domain Driven Design
    * Domain
        ** Subdomain
        ** Domain Modelling
        ** Domain experts
    * Context Map
    * Ubiquitous Language
    * Application service, domain layer, Infrastucture layer
    * Aggregate, Entity, Value
    * Big ball of mud

- Service Oriented Architecture
    * Service interact with each using well defined API

- Database
    * Relational
    * Key Value Paradigm
        ** Mongo
        ** Cassandra
        ** Dynamodb
    * Transaction Isolation Levels
        ** Read Committed
        ** Repeatable Read
        ** Read Uncommitted
        ** Serializable
    * ACID
        ** Atomic
        ** Consistent
        ** Isolated
        ** Durable
    * Transaction

- Caching 
    * Redis, Memcache, aws Elasticcache 
    * app reads from cache, if miss read from db
    * app write to db, write to cache
    * app write to cache, write to db
    * app write to cache, cache asynchrnously saves to db
