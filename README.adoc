= Backend Engineering

== Concepts

- Protocols
    * TCP
    * UDP
    * Http
    * Rest
    * GraphQl
    * Websockets
    * gRpc

- Object-Oriented Design
    * Abstraction
        ** Only relevant, client tailored API is exposed to clients
    * Polymorphism
        ** Method changes behavior at runtime
    * Inheritance
        ** Reusing parent class functionality
    * Encapsulation
        ** Hiding information and keeping related functionality together
    * Composition, Aggregation
        ** Instead of inheritance, composition uses the object to achieve code reuse
        ** Aggregation: Relation where A has B and B can exist without A
        ** Composition: Relation where A has B and B can NOT exist without A

- Open API
    * Contract Driven Design

- Domain Driven Design
    * Domain
        ** Subdomain
        ** Domain Modelling
        ** Domain experts
    * Context Map
    * Ubiquitous Language
    * Application service, domain layer, Infrastucture layer
    * Aggregate, Entity, Value
    * Big ball of mud

- Service Oriented Architecture (Microservices)
    * Service interacts with each other using well-defined API

- Concurrency
    * Process vs Thread.
         ** Process is instance of program in execution. Has a separate address space. Can not access data of other process directly
         ** Thread: A thread is a particular execution path of a process
    * Semaphores vs mutexes
      ** A mutex is a locking mechanism used to synchronize access to a resource while a semaphore is more like a signaling mechanism
      ** A semaphore is a signalling mechanism that restricts the number of simultaneous users for a shared resource up to a maximum number. Threads can request access to the resource (by decrementing the semaphore) and can signal that they have finished using the resource (by incrementing the semaphore).
      ** A mutex provides mutual exclusion. For example, either a producer or a consumer can have the key (mutex) to proceed with their work. As long as the buffer is being filled by the producer, the consumer needs to wait and vice-versa.
    * Starving
         ** Thread can not make progress due to greedy or high prioritized threads getting access to resource before starved thread
    * Deadlock
         ** Threads waiting on each other for releasing the resource
    * LiveLock
         ** Thread is too busy responding events than doing progressing or doing useful work

- Database
    * Relational
        ** popular choices: mysql, postgres, oracle, sqlserver
    * Indexes
    * Sharding
    * Consistent Hashing
    * Partitioning
    * CAP
    * Document Oriented Database
        ** Key Value Paradigm
            *** MongoDB
            *** Cassandra
            *** Dynamodb
            *** CouchDB, RethinkDb
    * Graph databases
        * Neo4j
    * Transaction.
    * Transaction Isolation Levels
        ** Read Committed
        ** Repeatable Read.
        ** Read Uncommitted
        ** Serializable
    * ACID
        ** Atomic
        ** Consistent
        ** Isolated
        ** Durable

- Caching 
    * Redis, Memcache, aws Elastic Cache
    * Eviction policies
        * LRU
        * Least Frequently used
    * Caching Strategies
    * app reads from cache, if miss read from db
    * app write to db, write to cache
    * app write to cache, write to db
    * app write to cache, cache asynchrnously saves to db
    
- Testing
    * Unit testing the logic
    * Integration testing
    * Contract Driven Testing
        ** https://pact.io[pact.io]
        ** https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/reference/html[spring cloud contract]

- Tools for Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
    * New Relic, Datadog, Appdynamics, Promethus
    * API Performance Monitoring
    * Infrastructure Monitoring
    * Alerting (OpsGenie, Pagerduty)

- Log or events Aggregation
    * Querying
    * Visualization

- DevOPs
    * Developer knows how to create, deploy and maintain their infrastructure resource
    * Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment(CICD)
    * Manual deployment is avoided
    * Manual testing is minimized
    * Process are optimized for faster release cycle
        ** Bugs are inevitable, so we embrace them by optimizing our processes to fix them faster
